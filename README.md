Target user profile: The final user will be someone specialized in the computer branch 
or someone looking for a worker in this field, taking into account my skills, which are focused on computing.
Expecting to find someone who has experience with Excel or Photoshop(for example).


Information architecture: This CV is divided in 2 parts, on the right there is a section with some short length data 
like the skills, languages that I speak or my contacts. And on the left there's the long length information like a 
brief description of myself along with my education(I've only included the non-mandatory one) and my work experience.


Visual design: I've used a cold palette with a dark blue and lighter one, in contrast with this cold palette, 
I've used yellow stars on the skills list to highlight this part. On the other parts of the right section there are 
some more icons to make the CV less boring. The typography used is Georgia, Times for the header and h2 texts 
and Verdana, Arial for the body.
